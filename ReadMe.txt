*** Decision Trees considered for this experiment:

    * Standard Decision Tree (Axis-parallel splits)
    * Oblique Classifier 1 with Bagging
    * Weighted Oblique Decision Tree with Bagging
    * Randomized CART with Bagging
    * HouseHolder CART with Bagging
    * Continuous Optimization of Oblique Splits with Bagging
    * Deep Neural Decision Trees with Bagging
    * Non-Linear Decision Trees with Bagging


*** In this experiment we have to skip OC1, DNDT and, NDT classifier due to its computational time.
